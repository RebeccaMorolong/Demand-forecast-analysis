# 📦 Demand Forecast Analysis

## 🧠 Business Problem
Retail and logistics companies often face challenges in matching inventory with customer demand. Overstocking leads to increased holding costs, while understocking results in missed sales and dissatisfied customers.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To build a time series model that forecasts future demand accurately, enabling better inventory planning and operational efficiency.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Facebook Prophet for Time Series Forecasting
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel for initial data review

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and aggregated daily sales data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Identified trends and seasonality.
   - Visualized spikes during promotional periods.
3. **Forecasting Model**:
   - Applied Prophet to forecast next quarter's demand.
   - Tuned model with holidays and changepoints for accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared forecasted vs actual demand.
   - Calculated MAPE and RMSE for performance metrics.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Demand peaks during Q4 due to holiday shopping.
- Prophet model achieved a forecasting accuracy of ~87%.
- Forecast shows a steady increase of 12% in demand for Q1 next year.

## 💼 Business Impact
If implemented in a retail business, this model could:
- Reduce stockouts by ~15%
- Decrease overstocking costs by ~10%
- Improve warehouse planning and delivery scheduling
