# 📦 Demand Forecast Analysis

Forecasting future demand is crucial for optimizing inventory, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction. This project applies data science techniques to **analyze and forecast product demand** using historical sales data.

---

## 📚 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand sales trends and seasonal patterns
- Build a model that predicts future demand
- Offer actionable business insights for inventory planning

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many businesses struggle with overstocking or understocking due to inaccurate demand estimation. By analyzing past demand behavior, we aim to forecast future sales trends and enable **data-driven stock management**.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Statsmodels / sklearn** – Time-series modeling and forecasting  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

---

## 📈 Data Exploration & Insights

- Sales show **weekly and monthly seasonality**, making time-based modeling essential.
- Certain products experience **promotional spikes**—likely influenced by marketing campaigns.
- Demand patterns vary significantly between products and months.

### 🧩 Sample Visuals:
- Demand over time per product  
- Monthly trends  
- Forecast vs actuals

---

## 📊 Forecasting Model

I implemented a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or SARIMA depending on the data fit), using:
- Stationarity checks
- Seasonal decomposition
- Residual diagnostics

### 📌 Key Results:
- **MAE/MAPE** used to evaluate performance  
- Forecast model successfully predicts future demand trends with good accuracy  
- Businesses can use this to avoid **overstocking/stockouts** and improve **operational efficiency**

---

## 🧭 Business Impact

By forecasting demand:
- Inventory planning becomes proactive, not reactive  
- Warehousing and logistics costs can be optimized  
- Customer satisfaction improves due to better product availability
